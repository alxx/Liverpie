Liverpie 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Full documentation is now only maintained at http://www.liverpie.com because 
I got tired of editing the same things in two places.


CREDITS
-------
Jonathan Palley, author of Telegraph for FreeSWITCH, wrote the part that
instantiates an EventMachine and creates a server ready for FreeSWITCH.
I wrote everything else and changed some of Jonathan's code.

I'm available for consultancy regarding installation and usage of Liverpie.

Adeel Ansari helped with the Java example and also worked with me to fix
a bug that prevented some Java webservers that don't always send a cookie
to work with Liverpie.
